Project Introduction: 
We created a pan/tilt mechanism using the 2 servos and 1 distance sensor provided for us that is controlled by an Arduino. Since the servos and sensors must be returned after the mini project, we mechanically designed our project so that we could disassemble our design. We transmitted servo angle and distance information from our sensor to our laptop for storage and, ultimately, visualization. Using a software package of our choice (Python) we created a 3D visual representation of an object of known, well-defined geometry, for our example we used a christmas tree. We themed our project around Christmas.
